* [OlafenwaMoses/ImageAI](https://github.com/OlafenwaMoses/ImageAI)

In ImageAi sind 4 verschiedene Algorithmen und Modeltypen f√ºr die Bilderkennung enthalten.
## ResNet-50
ResNet-50 is a 50-layer convolutional neural network (48 convolutional layers, one MaxPool layer, and one average pool layer). Residual neural networks are a type of artificial neural network (ANN) that forms networks by stacking residual blocks.
* [ResNet50](https://github.com/OlafenwaMoses/ImageAI/releases/download/3.0.0-pretrained/resnet50-19c8e357.pth) by Microsoft Research (Size = 98 mb, fast prediction time and high accuracy)

## MobileNetV2
MobileNetV2 is a convolutional neural network architecture that seeks to perform well on mobile devices. 
* [MobileNetV2](https://github.com/OlafenwaMoses/ImageAI/releases/download/3.0.0-pretrained/mobilenet_v2-b0353104.pth) (Size = 4.82 mb, fastest prediction time and moderate accuracy)

## InceptionV3
Inception v3[1][2] is a convolutional neural network for assisting in image analysis and object detection, and got its start as a module for GoogLeNet. It is the third edition of Google's Inception Convolutional Neural Network, originally introduced during the ImageNet Recognition Challenge. 
* [InceptionV3](https://github.com/OlafenwaMoses/ImageAI/releases/download/3.0.0-pretrained/inception_v3_google-1a9a5a14.pth) by Google Brain team (Size = 91.6 mb, slow prediction time and higher accuracy)

## DenseNet121

* [DenseNet121](https://github.com/OlafenwaMoses/ImageAI/releases/download/3.0.0-pretrained/densenet121-a639ec97.pth) by Facebook AI Research (Size = 31.6 mb, slower prediction time and highest accuracy)

# Object Detection

## RetinaNet
RetinaNet is one of the best one-stage object detection models that has proven to work well with dense and small scale objects
* [RetinaNet](https://github.com/OlafenwaMoses/ImageAI/releases/download/3.0.0-pretrained/retinanet_resnet50_fpn_coco-eeacb38b.pth) (Size = 130 mb, high performance and accuracy, with longer detection time)

# Bugs

* Bug: `[W NNPACK.cpp:80] Could not initialize NNPACK! Reason: Unsupported hardware.`
* Fix: `export USE_NNPACK=0`
---
* Bug: Deprecated Warning `The parameter 'pretrained' is deprecated since 0.13` 
* Fix:
```python
# Deprecated
from torchvision import models
model = models.resnet50(pretrained=True)
# New
from torchvision import models
model = models.resnet50(weights='ResNet50_Weights.DEFAULT')
```

* Bug:  `No module named 'tkinter'`
* Fix: `sudo apt-get install python3-tk`
